## 🪝 Hooks Used

Your Password Generator uses several **React Hooks** to manage state, side effects, and performance optimizations:

| Hook              | Purpose                                                                                                                   |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`useState`**    | To store and manage dynamic values such as `length`, `numberAllowed`, `characterAllowed`, and `password`.                 |
| **`useEffect`**   | To automatically regenerate the password whenever dependencies (like length or checkboxes) change.                        |
| **`useCallback`** | To memoize functions (`generatePassword` and `copyPassword`) so they don’t get recreated unnecessarily on each re-render. |
| **`useRef`**      | To directly reference the password `<input>` field for selecting and copying its text to the clipboard.                   |

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Set the desired **length** of your password using the range slider.
2. Toggle **Number** or **Character** checkboxes as per your need.
3. Click **Copy** to copy the generated password to clipboard.
4. Each setting change automatically regenerates a new password.
